## Quant GMM
# Introduction 
This rep is a personal project, for the applications of Generalized Methods of Moments, in the style of John Cochrane to financial data and models. The model stems from his book _Asset Pricing_, and this rep samples some well known diffusion models in finance and applied GMM methods to the moment statistics to those diffusion moments. The folder [GMM](gmm) makes each base models in the folder named [base_models](gmm/base_models) as python class as a GMM model of each of the models moments via the [models](gmm/models) folder. A simple test of the models has been implemented by the use of YahooFinance plugin in python in the folder [model_tests](gmm/model_tests). Example applications to empiricla data are present in the jupyter notebooks with initials ex. in the [main directory](https://github.com/glvn5150/quant_gmm)
